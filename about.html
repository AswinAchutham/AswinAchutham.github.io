    <p class="myself">As an enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible professional, I take pride in my ability to
        handle multiple tasks with ease. My experience both in team collaborations and individual 
        work has equipped me with versatile skills that contribute to my effectiveness in any setting.
        As a dedicated volunteer of the National Service Scheme (NSS) and a valued member of the
        ISTE MBCET Student Chapter, I have actively participated in various initiatives aimed at 
        serving the community and promoting academic excellence.

        Notably, I had the honor of serving as the Student Co-ordinator at NSS MBCET, where I 
        successfully organized and executed impactful social projects. My dedication to academic 
        pursuits is evident through my achievement as a winner in The Essay Competition 
        conducted by ISTE MBCET SB.Beyond academics, I have also played a significant role in
        fostering a vibrant college culture, having hosted numerous cultural events in connection 
        with our College Day celebrations.
      
        My commitment to personal growth and dedication to making a positive impact continues to 
        drive me in both my professional and personal endeavors.
